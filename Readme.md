# Crypto Currencies Project

After finishing the React course by Maximilian on Udemy, I made this project to enhance my learning. I am open to feedback, so please feel free to correct me if there are any mistakes in the code (I would be extremely grateful).
also: the design of this project was taken from this repo: https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_cryptoverse
(but the code and technologies are completely different)
